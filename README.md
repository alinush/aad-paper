# Transparency Logs via Append-only Authenticated Dictionaries
 
This is the LaTeX source code for our ACM CCS'19 paper on building asymptotically-optimal transparency logs from bilinear and RSA accumulators.
This is a first step towards append-only logs that are efficient to search remotely in a provable manner.

## Errata

To quickly see the changes we've made since the ACM camera-ready version, go here:

A few noteworthy changes:

 - We had a very unfortunate typo/omission in our *dictionary*'s append-only security definition.
